      "content": "  I find the great physicist Roger Penrose's explanation of consciousness, or lack thereof, to be of peace to my mind. I say this because, in light of the AI boom and talks of AGI eventually being created, Roger Penrose argues that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is fundamentally impossible. This is assuming the definition: 'A machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can.'\n\n On the surface, it seems like have already arrived in the age of AGI. LLMs have a knowledge base far greater than any human, and can now perform many tasks with ease. But part of the beauty of human intellect and capability derives from the fact that we have consciousness. Well, why can't AI have consciousness? If you boil it down, the human brain functions through action potentials, or the firing of electrical signals between neurons in the brain. Sounds eerily similar to the movement of electricity through transistors on the GPUs powering modern AI models. Surely AI models already have consciousness, right?\n\n  This is where Penrose's argument comes into play. He believes that the current laws of physics are inadequate to explain consciousness, as the mind does not function purely algorithmically. He proposes the possibility (though purely speculative) that consciousness may be explainable by quantum phenomena like the collapse of the wave function. I'm not going to sit here and pretend I understand that. However, I find his argument quite fascinatingâ€”and I'm a little more hopeful that the beauty of the human mind will never be replaced by ChatGPT o4-mini-high. :)"
